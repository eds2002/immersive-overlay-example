# Immersive overlay example

As seen on X (thank you for the positive comments!), this is a component inspired by the apple intellgence animation, if you have an iOS device and apple intelligence enabled, long press your power button to see it in action.

Not a full replica, as this component was built for my own personal needs, however I think something great came out of it.

That being said, since my app is developed for iOS, I have not tested in android ðŸ˜­, however, this is using well managed packages such as expo-blur, skia, and reanimated. Fingers crossed all is well.

Create an expo dev build

```
npm install

npx expo prebuild 

npx expo run ios

```
